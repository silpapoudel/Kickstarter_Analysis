# Kickstarter_Analysis
## Overview of Project

- Purpose of this analysis is to find the different campaigns fared. Using relation to theater outcomes based on launch date and outcomes based on goals

## Analysis and Challenges
- In outcomes based on goals section i had hard time finding the percentage rate on goals. I used chapter 1 videos to find the percentage

## Results

- During the month of May and June the success and fail rate is higher. There are more success rates than both fail and cancel rate
- We can also create bar graph
